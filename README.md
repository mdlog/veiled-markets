## FPMM Trading Model

Veiled Markets uses a **Fixed Product Market Maker** (FPMM), the same model used by Gnosis and Polymarket.

### How it works

**Buy (complete-set minting):** User deposits collateral, receives shares in chosen outcome. The AMM mints a complete set of shares and sells the unwanted ones back to the pool.

```
Binary: shares_out = amount * (reserve_yes + reserve_no + amount) / (reserve_other + amount)
```

**Sell (complete-set burning):** User specifies tokens to withdraw (`tokens_desired` approach). Contract computes shares needed from the user's outcome to burn a complete set and release collateral. No `sqrt` needed on-chain.

```
Binary: shares_needed = tokens_desired * (r_i + r_other - td) / (r_other - td)
```

**Redeem:** Winning shares redeem 1:1 (1 share = 1 token). Losing shares = 0.

### `expected_shares` Pattern

Frontend pre-computes shares from the FPMM formula, the `OutcomeShare` record stores this value, and finalize validates `shares_out >= expected_shares`. This fixes the quantity=0 bug from v13 where records had no share quantity.

### Fees (per trade)

| Fee | Rate | Recipient |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Protocol | 0.5% | Protocol treasury |
| Creator | 0.5% | Market creator |
| LP | 1.0% | Liquidity providers (stays in pool) |
| **Total** | **2.0%** | |

### Implied Price

Outcome prices are derived from pool reserves:

```
Binary:
  price_yes = reserve_no / (reserve_yes + reserve_no)
  price_no  = reserve_yes / (reserve_yes + reserve_no)

N-outcome:
  price_i = product(r_j for j != i) / sum_of_products
```

## Market Resolution

Markets follow a 3-step on-chain resolution process with a built-in dispute window:

### Resolution Flow

```
1. close_market      →  Status: ACTIVE → CLOSED        (anyone, after deadline)
2. resolve_market    →  Status: CLOSED → PENDING        (resolver only)
3. finalize_resolution → Status: PENDING → RESOLVED     (anyone, after challenge window)
```

### Resolve Panel UI

The **Resolve** tab on the market detail page guides the resolver through all 3 steps:

- **Step 1 — Close Market:** Closes betting after the market deadline has passed
- **Step 2 — Resolve Market:** Resolver selects the winning outcome (only the designated resolver address can execute this step)
- **Step 3 — Finalize:** After the challenge window (~800 blocks, ~2-3 hours) passes with no disputes, anyone can finalize the resolution

Each step shows transaction status, block countdown for the challenge window, and auto-advances to the next step after confirmation.

### Dispute Mechanism

During the challenge window (between resolve and finalize), anyone can dispute the resolution:

1. **Disputer** calls `dispute_resolution` with a proposed different outcome + 1 ALEO bond
2. Market status resets to **CLOSED**, resolution is removed
3. **Resolver** must re-resolve the market with a corrected outcome
4. A new challenge window begins
5. After finalization, if the final outcome matches the disputer's proposed outcome, the disputer can reclaim their bond via `claim_dispute_bond`

### Needs Resolution Filter

The Dashboard includes a **"Needs Resolution"** sort option (Gavel icon) that filters to show only expired/ended markets that still need to be resolved. This helps resolvers easily find markets awaiting action.

## Privacy Model

| Data | Visibility |
|------|-----------|
| Market question, total pool, reserves, prices | Public |
| Your trade amount and outcome position | Private (ZK-encrypted) |
| Your wallet address in buy transactions | Private (`transfer_private_to_public`) |
| Market creation, resolution | Public |

### How Privacy Works

ALEO buy shares use `buy_shares_private`, which calls `credits.aleo/transfer_private_to_public` internally. This means:

1. User provides a **private credits record** (not public balance)
2. The transfer is from private to public — observer sees tokens arrive at the program address but **cannot link** them to the sender
3. The `OutcomeShare` record is returned to the user as an encrypted record

USDCX markets use `buy_shares_usdcx` with `transfer_public_as_signer` (less private, but necessary for stablecoin mechanics).

## Frontend Features

### Market Detail — Inline Trading

The market detail page has an integrated **Buy/Sell** tab toggle in the right sidebar:

- **Buy Tab:** Select outcome (2-4 options with custom labels and colors), enter amount, preview shares received with price impact and fees, execute via wallet
- **Sell Tab:** Auto-fetch `OutcomeShare` records from wallet, select position, enter withdrawal amount, preview shares burned and net tokens received, execute sell
- **Resolve Tab:** 3-step resolution wizard (close → resolve → finalize) with challenge window countdown
- Manual record paste fallback for wallets that don't support record fetching

### Multi-Outcome Support

- **2 outcomes:** Binary markets (Yes/No) — green/red color scheme
- **3 outcomes:** Triple markets — green/red/purple
- **4 outcomes:** Quad markets — green/red/purple/yellow
- **Custom labels:** Creator enters custom outcome names during market creation (e.g., "Apple", "Google", "Meta", "Amazon")
- **Pool Breakdown:** Dynamic visualization showing reserves, percentages, and payout multipliers for all outcomes

### My Bets — Position & Trade Tracking

- Tracks both **buy** and **sell** transactions
- Buy entries show **shares received** (fixed at time of purchase)
- Sell entries show **shares sold** and **tokens received** (with purple SELL badge)
- Auto-promotes stale pending bets (>2 minutes) to active status
  - `at1...` IDs: verified on-chain via explorer API
  - `shield_xxx` IDs: auto-promoted (Shield Wallet confirms on-chain)
- Tabs: All, Accepted, Unredeemed, Settled
- Import existing bets by transaction ID
- Claim winnings / refunds directly from bet cards

### Wallet Integration

- **Shield Wallet** as primary wallet (returns `shield_xxx` event IDs, handled by background blockchain scanner)
- **Puzzle Wallet** support via server-side delegated proving (WalletConnect V2)
- Transaction polling with on-chain verification fallback
- Credits record fetching for private buy transactions (3 wallet strategies with fallback)

```

### Build Contract

```bash
cd contracts
leo build
# Output: 1969 statements, 30 transitions
```

### Deploy Contract

```bash
cd contracts
leo deploy --network testnet --yes --broadcast
# Cost: ~60.72 ALEO for v15
```

## Create a Market (CLI)

```bash
# Get current block height
CURRENT_BLOCK=$(curl -s "https://api.explorer.provable.com/v1/testnet/block/height/latest")

# Calculate deadlines
DEADLINE=$((CURRENT_BLOCK + 100000))    # ~5 days
RESOLUTION=$((CURRENT_BLOCK + 200000))  # ~10 days

# Create market (7 inputs)
snarkos developer execute veiled_markets_v15.aleo create_market \
  "<question_hash>field" \
  "3u8" \
  "2u8" \
  "${DEADLINE}u64" \
  "${RESOLUTION}u64" \
  "<resolver_address>" \
  "10000000u128" \
  --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
  --network 1 \
  --endpoint "https://api.explorer.provable.com" \
  --broadcast \
  --priority-fee 3000000
```

Parameters:
1. `question_hash` — BHP256 hash of the question string
2. `category` — 1-7 (Politics, Sports, Crypto, Entertainment, Tech, Economics, Science)
3. `num_outcomes` — 2, 3, or 4
4. `deadline` — Block height for betting cutoff
5. `resolution_deadline` — Block height for resolution cutoff
6. `resolver` — Address authorized to resolve the market
7. `initial_liquidity` — In microcredits (10000000 = 10 ALEO)

## Wallet Setup

**Recommended:** [Shield Wallet](https://shieldwallet.io/)

1. Install Shield Wallet browser extension
2. Switch to **Testnet** network
3. Get test credits from [Aleo Faucet](https://faucet.aleo.org)
4. Connect wallet in the app — this registers `veiled_markets_v15.aleo`

> **Note:** If you see "program not in allowed programs" error, disconnect and reconnect Shield Wallet to re-register the program.

### Wallet Compatibility

| Wallet | Create Market | Buy Shares | Sell Shares | Status |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Shield Wallet | Yes | Yes | Yes | Primary wallet |
| Puzzle Wallet | Untested | Untested | Untested | Server-side proving |
| Leo Wallet | No | No | No | Can't resolve 4-level import chain |

### Known Shield Wallet Behavior

- Returns `shield_xxx` event IDs instead of `at1...` transaction IDs
- Child transitions (`transfer_public_as_signer`) may show as ACCEPTED while parent shows REJECTED in Shield UI — but the on-chain transaction is actually ACCEPTED
- App handles this with auto-promotion of stale pending bets and background blockchain scanning

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Contract** | Leo (Aleo), snarkVM |
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion |
| **State** | Zustand |
| **Wallet** | ProvableHQ Aleo Wallet Adapter |
| **UI Components** | Radix UI (Dialog, Tabs, Slider, Tooltip, Progress) |
| **Persistence** | Supabase (cross-device bet tracking) + localStorage |
| **Hosting** | Vercel |
| **Build** | vite-plugin-wasm, vite-plugin-top-level-await |

## Development

```bash
# Frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Build for production
cd frontend && npm run build

# Type check
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

# Build contract
cd contracts && leo build

# SDK tests
cd sdk && npm test
```

### Vite Build Configuration

The `@provablehq/sdk` requires specific Vite config:

- `vite-plugin-wasm` + `vite-plugin-top-level-await` for WASM support
- `optimizeDeps.exclude: ['@provablehq/wasm', '@provablehq/sdk']`
- `build.target: 'esnext'` and `worker.format: 'es'`
- COOP/COEP headers needed for SharedArrayBuffer in dev mode
- Do NOT use `commonjsOptions.exclude` for `@provablehq` (breaks `core-js` require)

## Data Persistence

### Outcome Labels

Custom outcome labels (for 3-4 outcome markets) are saved to `localStorage` during market creation, keyed by both question hash and market ID. When a market is loaded, `market-store.ts` looks up saved labels before falling back to defaults ("Outcome 1", "Outcome 2", etc.).

### Bet & Sell Tracking

All buy and sell transactions are recorded in Zustand store and persisted to `localStorage` (per-address) and optionally Supabase. Each entry tracks:
- **Buy:** stake amount, outcome, shares received, locked multiplier
- **Sell:** tokens desired, shares sold, net tokens received

## Audit Fixes (v10+)

| ID | Fix |
|----|-----|
| C-01 | `market_bettors` mapping for unique bettor tracking |
| C-02 | `market_credits` mapping for per-market credit isolation |
| C-03 | `resolver` field added to Market struct (separate from creator) |
| H-01 | Removed predictable noise/delay mechanism |
| H-02 | User nonce in commit_bet, reveal deadline enforcement |

## Version History

| Version | Key Changes |
|---------|-------------|
| **v15** | Fixed dispute lifecycle bugs: `resolve_market` now clears stale dispute data on re-resolve, `emergency_cancel` cleans up resolution/dispute state, `claim_dispute_bond` uses unforgeable `DisputeBondReceipt` record instead of mapping (prevents stuck markets). Added Resolve Panel UI (3-step resolution wizard), "Needs Resolution" dashboard filter |
| v14 | FPMM AMM with correct formulas, `buy_shares_private` only (ALEO), `expected_shares` pattern, `sell_shares` tokens_desired approach + `credits.aleo/transfer_public`, multisig treasury governance, custom outcome labels, multi-outcome pool breakdown, sell tracking in My Bets |
| v13 | Fixed ternary underflow bug in buy_shares (Leo evaluates both branches) |
| v12 | Initial FPMM implementation, multi-outcome markets, LP provision |
| v11 | USDCX stablecoin integration, dual-token markets |
| v10 | Audit fixes (C-01, C-02, C-03, H-01, H-02), dispute resolution |

## Testnet Markets

Markets are registered in `frontend/public/markets-index.json` and `frontend/src/lib/question-mapping.ts`.

Creating markets via the frontend dashboard or CLI populates these registries. Outcome labels are persisted in `localStorage` and looked up by question hash or market ID. The blockchain indexer (`backend/`) can scan for new markets automatically.
